<h4>Introduction</h4>

As a web developer, I have created a comprehensive personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experiences. This project utilizes a combination of modern web development technologies, including React, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Git, and Node.js, to deliver a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user experience.

<h5>Technologies Used</h5>

<h6>1.React</h6>

The website is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for modular, reusable components, ensuring maintainability and scalability of the codebase.

<h6>2.Bootstrap</h6>

To streamline the design process and ensure a responsive layout, Bootstrap is integrated into the project. This popular CSS framework provides pre-designed components and a flexible grid system, enhancing the overall user experience across various devices.

<h6>3.Node.js</h6>

For development and build processes, Node.js is used. It serves as the runtime environment for various build tools and development dependencies, streamlining the workflow.

<h6>4.HTML & CSS</h6>

The backbone of the website's structure and styling. HTML is used to define the content and structure, while CSS is employed to create visually appealing styles and layouts. Custom CSS is also used to override Bootstrap defaults where necessary, adding a unique touch to the design.

<h6>5.Git</h6>

Version control is managed using Git, which tracks changes and facilitates collaborative development. This ensures that the project history is well-documented, and any version of the project can be accessed or restored if needed.

The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This is achieved through Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities.
